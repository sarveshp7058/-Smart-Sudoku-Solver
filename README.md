Smart-Sudoku-Solver
🧩 Sudoku Solver (Java)
A Java-based application that automatically solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. This project was developed as Task 03 of the Software Development Internship at SkillCraft Technology.

📌 Project Overview
Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle where the goal is to fill a 9×9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

This program:

Accepts an unsolved Sudoku grid as input
Applies a backtracking algorithm
Automatically fills in the missing numbers
Displays the solved Sudoku grid
🚀 Features
Solves standard 9×9 Sudoku puzzles
Uses backtracking algorithm for accurate results
Validates number placement based on Sudoku rules
Console-based, easy to understand
Written using core Java programming concepts
🛠️ Technologies Used
Java
Core Java concepts (loops, arrays, recursion, conditionals)
Algorithmic problem-solving
